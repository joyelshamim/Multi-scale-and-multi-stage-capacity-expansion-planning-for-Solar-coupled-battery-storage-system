# Project Description

This repository presents the capacity expansion model for a strategically integrated renewable energy system in Hjartdal municipality, located in Upper Telemark within **Vestfold og Telemark county, Norway**
The model validation is conducted across five distinct scenarios designed to comprehensively evaluate system performance under varying operational and technological conditions shown in the Table.

| **Scenario No** | **Scenarios**                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| 1               | Business-as-usual (BAU)            |
| 2               | Technology Maturity                |
| 3               | PV and BESS degradation            |
| 4               | Degradation and Tech Maturity      |
| 5               | Energy secure                      |

The validation framework uses five progressively complex scenarios:

**BAU** â€“ Baseline system performance without tech advances or degradation.
**Technology Maturity** â€“ Assesses the impact of improved renewable technologies and cost reductions.
**Degradation** â€“ Evaluates effects of PV and BESS performance degradation over time.
**Degradation and Tech Maturity** â€“ Considers both degradation and tech maturity for realistic long-term projections.
**Energy Security** â€“ Adds redundancy constraints to test system resilience under partial outages.

This approach enables comprehensive validation of the optimization model and highlights the impact of each factor on system planning.

## Network Overview

![Powerline diagram of the network topology](Analysis/power_line_diagram.png)

The electrical power network centers around the **Alamoen substation (B)** and consists of five primary nodes interconnected through transmission lines of varying voltage levels and distances.

- A **120 MW hydropower facility (A)** in the HjartdÃ¸la area connects to Alamoen via a 10 km 2Ã—132 kV line.
- A **103 MW solar PV plant (C)** under construction connects directly to Alamoen via a 132 kV line.
- Power is distributed from Alamoen to the **Reskjem substation (E)** via a 15 km 132 kV transmission line.
- A proposed **150 MW solar power plant (D)** is planned in Hjartdal, 1.8 km from Alamoen, connected via a 0.25 km feeder line and 33 kV switchgear.

## Data Standardisation
The model is driven by the different resolution time-series datasets corresponding to three generation units and the overall network demand, as shown in the table below.

| **Sl No** | **Datasets**            | **Time Resolution** |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| 1         | Load Demand              | 10 min               |
| 2         | Solar PV generation      | 15 min               |
| 3         | Hydro generation         | 5 min                |
| 4         | Alamoen PV generation    | 60 min               |


The dataset comprises a 15-year temporal span, incorporating both historical operational data and forecasted projections from 2025 to 2039.

ðŸ•’ Multi-Scale Data Standardization
The model standardizes datasets with varying time resolutions into four uniform intervals: 5-min, 15-min, 30-min, and 1-hour, ensuring consistency for performance evaluation across temporal scales.

âš¡ Demand vs Generation Insight (2025â€“2039)
From 2025 to 2039, demand grows from 150.8 MW to 293.0 MW, while total generation from PV, hydro, and Alamoen PV remains static at ~163.8 MW, highlighting a significant energy gap shown figure below.

## Model Validation in different scenarios

**Scenario 1 (business as usual) and 2 (technology maturity)**

![BAU Power Cable upgration planning](Analysis/BAU_Power_cable_upgration.png)

Grid Transmission Line: Consistent upgrade need in 2033â€“2034, with secondary upgrades by 2039 (30-min & 1-hr resolutions).
Solar Main Line: Highly resolution-sensitiveâ€”upgrades range from 2034 to 2039, occurring earlier in lower-resolution models.
Feeder Line: Most variableâ€”single upgrade in 2038 (5-min) vs. multiple upgrades from 2034â€“2039 (30-min); 1-hr shows only 2039.

![Scenario 1&2 loss](Analysis/scenario1_2_loss.png)

This figure shows 1.3% variation shows that time resolution impacts loss estimation in power system modelling.

![Scenario 1&2 Cost comparison](Analysis/Cost_contribution_scenario_1_2.png)

The cost comparison figure illustrated that thee technology maturity scenario demonstrates significant economic optimization potential through advanced renewable energy technologies and improved system efficiency parameters.

**Scenario 3 (PV and BESS degradation) and 4 (Degradation and Tech. Maturity)**
This analysis highlights how PV and BESS degradation (Scenarios 3 & 4) affect upgrade scheduling in Hjartdal's distribution network. Temporal resolution has a significant impact, with upgrade timings shifting based on the data granularity used in the analysis. This underscores the importance of accurate time resolution in long-term grid planning under component degradation. show below figure


![Scenario3_4 Power Cable upgration planning](Analysis/power_cable_upgradtion_scenario_3_4.png)

The below power losses figure demonstrates that loss computation exhibits sensitivity to sampling frequency, with notable variations across standard aggregation intervals.

![Scenario 3&4 loss](Analysis/Scenario_3_4_power_losses.png)

Cost contribution for upgration is showing in below figure

![Scenario 3&4 Cost comparison](Analysis/Cost_comparison_scenario_3_4.png)

**Scenario 5 (Tech Maturity)**

The below figure illustrates the grid Transmission Line: Requires upgrades across all resolutionsâ€”2034 for high-resolution (5-min to 30-min) and 2033 for 1-hour. Solar Main Line & Feeder Line: Upgrades begin in 2039 across all time resolutions, driven by energy security constraints, not data granularity.
This highlights the system's need for resilience-focused reinforcement under critical conditions.

![Scenario 5_ Power Cable upgration planning](Analysis/cable_upgration_scenario5.png)

The chart in Figure shows a clear pattern where longer time resolutions generally result in lower average losses

![Scenario 5 loss](Analysis/Scenario_5_losses.png)



| **Metric**                    | **5 min** | **15 min** | **30 min** | **1 h** |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Final PV Capacity (MW)        | 150.0     | 150.0      | 150.0      | 150.0   |
| Final BESS Capacity (MW)      | 52.0      | 62.2       | 63.1       | 70.2    |
| Power Generation Reduced (MW) | 46.6      | 46.6       | 46.6       | 46.6    |
| Unmet Demand (MW)             | 14.1      | 2.7        | 4.1        | 3.0     |
| Shortfall Cover Percentage    | 69.70%    | **94.20%** | 91.20%     | 93.60%  |

above table shows how effectively PV and BESS cover a 46.6 MW hydropower shortfall under the energy-secure scenario: 5-min resolution covers only 69.7% of the shortfall, leading to higher unmet demand. Coarser resolutions (15-min, 30-min, 1-hour) achieve 94.2%, 91.2%, and 93.6% coverage respectively.

The 15-minute resolution offers the best performance, balancing temporal accuracy and system adequacy.

## Findings

â€¢ The model shows that a 15-minute resolution results in the lowest average losses under the BAU scenario, even with technological maturity constraints. When degradation is included, losses gradually decrease with coarser resolutions.
â€¢ When the hydropower generation is reduced by half, the model maintains energy security but becomes highly sensitive to time resolution, with average power losses decreasing by nearly 21% from 5-minute to 1-hour intervals.
â€¢ Across all scenarios, the model demonstrates that higher temporal resolution datasets (e.g., 5-minute intervals) require fewer transmission cable upgrades compared to lower resolution datasets
â€¢ Considering the power cable upgrade requirements, the model indicates a 55.56% reduction in necessary cable upgrades compared to the Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario when degradation constraints are incorporated. However, under energy security conditions, the model requires 33.33% fewer cable upgrades relative to BAU.
â€¢ Under an energy-secure scenario in 2039, the model shows that coarser time resolutions significantly improve the systemâ€™s ability to cover a 46.6 MW hydropower shortfall, with the 15-minute resolution achieving the highest shortfall coverage at 94.2%, indicating an optimal balance between accuracy and system adequacy.
