The electrical power network centers around the **Alamoen substation (B)** and consists of five primary nodes interconnected through transmission lines of varying voltage levels and distances.

- A **120 MW hydropower facility (A)** in the Hjartdøla area connects to Alamoen via a 10 km 2×132 kV line.
- A **103 MW solar PV plant (C)** under construction connects directly to Alamoen via a 132 kV line.
- Power is distributed from Alamoen to the **Reskjem substation (E)** via a 15 km 132 kV transmission line.
- A proposed **150 MW solar power plant (D)** is planned in Hjartdal, 1.8 km from Alamoen, connected via a 0.25 km feeder line and 33 kV switchgear.
